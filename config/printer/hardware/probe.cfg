[bed_mesh]
speed: 150
horizontal_move_z: 20
mesh_min: 20,20
#   Defines the minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
mesh_max: 250,250
#   Defines the maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
probe_count: 5, 5
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values X, Y defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2, 2
#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#zero_reference_position:
#   An optional X,Y coordinate that specifies the location on the bed
#   where Z = 0.  When this option is specified the mesh will be offset
#   so that zero Z adjustment occurs at this location.  The default is
#   no zero reference.
#relative_reference_index:
#   **DEPRECATED, use the "zero_reference_position" option**
#   The legacy option superceded by the "zero reference position".
#   Rather than a coordinate this option takes an integer "index" that
#   refers to the location of one of the generated points. It is recommended
#   to use the "zero_reference_position" instead of this option for new
#   configurations. The default is no relative reference index.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.
